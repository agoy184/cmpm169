			<h1>Experiment 5: 3D Graphics</h1>

				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started off by creating primitive shapes in p5js, at first I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to make because there were so many possibilities. I started out by checking out all of the built-in 3D primitives that were creatable in p5js <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/3d-geometries.html">Link</a> The primitives I saw didn’t really stick out to me except for the torus, since it reminded me of a donut, I thought it would be funny to create some sort of donut related art so I started with the torus and tried to make it more “donut-like
				</p>
				<p>After reshaping the donut, my thought process was “if you can have one, you can have a bunch.” So I used a for loop to generate a bunch of donuts.  It looked nicer, but it was still a bit bland to me, so I was trying to figure out how to make it seem more appealing.  I’d used the sample code to make the donuts spin, but they were doing so pretty uniformly which was also boring.  I decided I wanted to make them spin in different directions. Creating an arrangement of donuts that was spinning randomly was my goal from this point on.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>Rotating the donuts based on frame count and a random factor made them spin a bit fast, and it really didn’t look very appealing most of the time that I refreshed.  The random route almost didn’t seem like the way to go, so I tried working with a low factor and tried using my loop constants to make the donuts spin. </p>
				<p>After creating a spinning pattern that I was satisfied with, I imported a pink sprinkled donut texture to put onto the toruses, making them an arrangement of ‘actual’ donuts. <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/image">Link</a></p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>After that was said and done, I thought that the donuts spinning in white space seemed a bit bland, so I added a simple background.  I had accidentally placed a rectangle too close to the toruses, which caused them to dip into the rectangle like they were sinking.  This gave me the idea to have the toruses dipping into a pool of sprinkles instead.</p>
				<p>Utilizing the image p5js reference, I put in a large background of sprinkles for the donuts to dip in, and thought it looked pretty nice.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall, it was a somewhat enjoyable assignment.  Admittedly, I wasn’t able to create something as grandiose as what I envisioned, which OpenProcessing had set an expectation for.  However, there was a lot of stuff to learn from all of the examples and sketches I browsed.</p>
