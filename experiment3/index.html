			<h1>Experiment 3 - Generative Methods</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started off with the base code example M_1_5_03 that I found on generative-gestaltung.de (Link: http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?02_M/M_1_5_03). 
				</p>
				<p>I thought that the piece was captivating so I started playing around with the values in the source code.  Soon I found that every element of the supposedly randomly generated lines could be modified in any way that I pleased.  I started changing values relating to the noise and amount of agents, and was pleasantly surprised by the subsequent changes that followed. From this point on, after understanding most of the parameters I wanted to try and create my own sketch using the code.
				</p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After playing around with the code a bit, I’d created quite a few sketches of a similar matter.  Many of them didn’t have any rhyme or reason to them, but there were a few that really stuck to me in their resemblance to real life images. I likened one to sparks flying after a chinese fireworks festival.  
				</p>
				<p>I found that the parameter controlling the noise’s strength determined the direction that the “agents” would adopt.  The closer that the strength was to 0, the more horizontal the agents would travel across the screen. Seeing this, I altered the colors and agents to simulate something similar to shooting stars, and it worked.  
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>After more experimentation, I was deciding on what I wanted to create for the experiment. Although I was already kind of making the experiment I wasn’t happy with the sketches I’d made thus far. I looked outside of the section classroom to see the rain droplets falling along the window outside, and realized what I wanted to make.  
				</p>
				<p>I used an RGB color picker to determine the sky and rain colors that I wanted, and after that I altered the size of the droplets to what seemed right. I almost felt as if the piece felt done, but then for the fun of it I added a body of water below the rain to finish it off. Seeing the droplets go into the water body changes their color as well.  
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I think I did fairly well on this assignment. I learned a lot about noise and randomness.  The only thing that I regret from this assignment is my ability to properly embed it into my website. For some reason, whenever my sketch was put onto my website using the framework already set out for me, the page would slow down and ruin the format of the other text in the web page.  I had to use a workaround to put it on a separate page, and even there my sketch is slowed for some reason. It works fine on my p5js link though.
