			<h1>Experiment 6: Grammars & Text Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>In the beginning, I started off using another sketch as a base for my starting point. (Sketch link: https://editor.p5js.org/tom.smith/sketches/fASj3inoc) The sketch was a fairly simple text input piece that would take a word that the user submits, and randomizes it about on the screen. It was simple enough, so I tried building off of it.</p>
				<p>After copying the source code of the original sketch, I started to play around with the parameters to figure out what made the text go where, and thus found out how to adjust the text’s X and Y position instead of making every word appear in a random position.  I also figured out how to change the frequency of words popping up, so I adjusted them to create something that seemed to be visually more pleasing to the eye.  I had created a simple sentence generator. (Reference: https://p5js.org/examples/dom-input-and-button.html)</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After the first few steps, I thought that a sentence art generator was a bit plain.  I was scrolling through sketches trying to find something to inspire me but everything that I thought was cool seemed a little too hard to integrate into something of my own creation.  I was changing my code a bunch to half-copy a lot of sketches, when I accidentally changed my function from ‘drawName’ to ‘draw’ instead.  I hadn’t realized until this point that I’d been using a different call function than the traditional ‘draw’ one, and when I switched it to draw the text started moving up and down the screen. I started playing around with the parameters and I thought it was pretty funny. (You can’t tell from the image below but the text is being redrawn every millisecond, so it looks kind of like it’s moving).  
				</p>
				<p> I thought this might be a fun avenue to play with, so I added more loops nesting the position, and then tried having the position change based on a multiple in the loop iterator.  I also played around with the text color to restrict it’s change a bit, I wasn’t sure what it reminded me of, but it seemed cool so I kept running with it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>After pondering for a bit about what to do with the piece thematically, I realized that the changing of the colors kind of reminded me of water, so I thought of creating an environment with a bunch of words. Starting off I just used water to create the pond itself.  I also added a dark blue night background that’d go with the night sky I was trying to make</p>
				<p>Next, I added a random orientation of stars to fill the night sky with, and created an assortment of grass, weeds, frogs, lilies, and pond plants to fill the edge of the lake.  The grammar rules that I used for my plant words are based on another sketch I found relating to pseudo random word connection.  (Link: https://editor.p5js.org/agoy184/sketches/d21QR2OIs)</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I learned a lot about grammars, and found it surprising how satisfying an art piece could be without using simple shape primitives or strokes.  Forcing myself only to use words made me have to think out of the box a bit more than usual, but I thought the final result looked pretty cool. My group for this class has already decided on what they want to make for the project, but now I can add a little bit more to the piece because of this new knowledge about text formats and grammar usage.</p>
