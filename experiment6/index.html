				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>In the beginning, I started off using another sketch as a base for my starting point. (Sketch link: https://editor.p5js.org/tom.smith/sketches/fASj3inoc) The sketch was a fairly simple text input piece that would take a word that the user submits, and randomizes it about on the screen. It was simple enough, so I tried building off of it.</p>
				<p>After copying the source code of the original sketch, I started to play around with the parameters to figure out what made the text go where, and thus found out how to adjust the textâ€™s X and Y position instead of making every word appear in a random position.  I also figured out how to change the frequency of words popping up, so I adjusted them to create something that seemed to be visually more pleasing to the eye.  I had created a simple sentence generator. (Reference: https://p5js.org/examples/dom-input-and-button.html)</p>
