				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I have some past experience with js through Phaser and website building, but I havent tinkered with p5.js all that much outside of a few abstract sketches on glitch.com 
					I was thinking about something that would be fun and interactive, and randomly thought about when I was a kid playing on the computer in Windows 95. There were times when a window wouldnt close, and trying to drag it away from the center of the screen would instead spawn more windows in a strange fashion. It almost felt fun for me to draw stuff with windows like that so I thought maybe I could make something similar.</p>

				<p>I started off by creating the standard box, and looked for a reference to control box clones using mouse input. After tinkering around with the parameters a bit, I thought I could do something a little more fun, which was a box thats shape evolved like a mouth

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After creating the singular changing box, I started to move my mouse around to the beat of some music that I was listening to. The expanding and shrinking of the box reminded me of how animated boomboxes would move in older cartoons, so I thought about creating something like that based off of what I already had.

				width = 200>
				<p>The code to create the other layered box buttons of the boombox were very similar to the implementation of the original box, I just needed to add multiplication/division factors to the parameters Id already set. 
					The real challenge for this part was creating the speaker shapes, and forcing them to stay on the sides. I figured out that you could utilize the height and width of the canvas in p5js, so then I utilized that as a parameter and it worked.

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>After I finished making the boombox’s structure, I realized that I still needed to make it feel “animated” in a way, since leaving your mouse still would make the art seem unresponsive and obviously unanimated.  I started by looking at some references for how time worked, and then stumbled across a page on colors realizing that my boombox looked a bit bland as it was.  I took it upon myself to try to make it look like a boombox that was under rave lights at a party, and got to work.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This project really helped me to familiarize myself with p5js more than I had experience with before. It was also just good as a general js refresher.

					Figuring out how to make the colors appear was honestly my favorite part, there’s just something about having a response to your work appear on screen that satisfies me, it kind of works the same way making a game does in terms of satisfaction. I have some more ideas now on what I want to create for future experiments, and learning with some other students in groups soon might turn out to be a really engaging way to learn.
