			<h1>Experiment 4 - Images, Video, & Sound Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>At first, I started out by playing around with camera filters and video capture. Looking through the different ways that you could change the look of your face on camera wasn't anything novel, but still kind of cool. <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/filter">Filter link</a>
				</p>
				<p>Next, it felt right to put a window frame over the cameras since the natural alignment I created with the cameras made it feel like it just fit in the space. With some math and proper adjustment, I was able to create this.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>There wasn’t a lot of interactivity involved yet in this stage, and I’d yet to add any “sound art” as the assignment suggested.  The window was making think of animal crossing for some reason, so I imported the track titled “6 PM” from the Animal Crossing OST.
				</p>
				<p>  After that I felt that it would be fun if the music stopped/played based on the user interacting with the piece, so I added functionality for that and added some text to instruct the player on what to do to interact with the environment.  I also looked at some other sound sketches for inspiration.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>For the cherry on the top, I thought it’d be cool to have some animal crossing characters dancing in the background of my sketch, so I imported two GIFs for the sketch of some dancing cats from the game.  I thought it was a little awkward when they kept dancing even when the music was not playing, so I added pause functionality to them so that they would only dance when the music was playing.  
				</p>
				<p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with how the final result turned out. It made me laugh, and showing it to my friend also made me laugh so I’m pretty satisfied with it.		</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I had a lot of fun working on this sketch. I still have some issues with the way that it's implemented into the webpage, those being sizing issues with the text and an unnecessary camera capture. However, I really can't complain with the end result. If you use Cmd minus twice you can see the sketch the way it's supposed to be seen on most laptop screens. This kind of makes me excited to work on something fun with other students.</p>
